        <h2 class="rapeMenHead">Rape: Men</h2>
        <p>Rape, typically thought of as predominantly a female struggle, is an issue that plagues both men, women, and those of the nonbinary preference. While the stories that flood the news typically feature women as the victims, rapes of males are often belittled or unheard of entirely. Two of the most common places for men to be raped or sexually assaulted include prisons/juvenile detention centers and the military. Male rape quite certainly exists, despite the lack of coverage and reporting. White societal factors and pressures limit the number of men who report sexual assault or rape, it nonetheless exists and is an issue that must be addressed. </p>
        <p></p> <br>
        <p>The root of the issue stems from the lack of societal acceptance and acknowledgement of victims. There is a rather common misconception that “men cannot be raped” or that “men always want sex” which are dangerous statements because it seemingly nullifies any man who has been sexually assaulted or raped. When it comes to the military, the issue lies within the “don’t Ask, don’t tell” act enacted by president bush. Male on male sexual harassment and sexual assault is more likely to be pressured under the rug, fearign the repurcussions of breaking this act, no matter the level of consent, or lack thereof. In addition, many men are pressured by traditional masculinity, which can be very damaging emotionally and cause many men to bottle up these feelings, leading  to less and less reported rapes. Coupled with the shame that many men feel from being raped, it’s no surprise that male rapes are under reported. Moreover, rapes committed by those in positions of influence have power over victims. The power dynamic is therby intensified by the rape and the costs of reporting the rape often outweigh any “benefit” (if you can even call it that). This vertical coercion allows those in positions of power to remain in power and tighten their holds of their victims. A cycle is also created. The shame from the rape prevents men from talking to other men about the experience, meaning a community is never extablished and victims feel isolated in their experience. From there, it is their word against the rapists, and well, without substantial proof of a lack of consent, court processions will never reach the stand. If a victim were to report, he/she would be immediately fired or in the case of the military, “illegally discharged under the false diagnosis of a personality disorder” (GQ.com) which is conveniently not covered by the Veterans affairs as it is considered a pre-existing condition.
