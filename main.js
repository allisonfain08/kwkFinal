var rape = ["Brock Turner, \n a former student and swimmer at Stanford University, was convicted of three felony counts of sexual assault and sentenced to just six months behind bars last week for raping an unconscious woman behind a dumpster. The judge's ruling has sparked outrage across the nation, moving many to sign a petition on Change.org to remove Santa Clara County Judge Aaron Persky from the bench. Two graduate students found Turner raping the woman, who was half-naked, outside a fraternity house around 1 a.m. They chased after Turner and held him down until police arrived. According to the victim, she had decided to accompany her younger sister to a party, though she had initially planned to stay home. After the assault, she woke up at a hospital and learned the details of her assault from the press. Turner, a then freshman, was arraigned at the Santa Clara County courthouse in Palo Alto, California. According to ABC, he pleaded not guilty to five felony charges, including attempted rape, rape of an intoxicated person, rape of an unconscious person, sexual penetration of an intoxicated woman and sexual penetration of an unconscious woman. He alleged that the two were hooking up at the party and he only fondled her. He was released on $150,000 bail. According to The Stanford Daily, Turner attended his preliminary hearing with his defense attorney, Michael Armstrong. Turner again pleaded not guilty, and two charges were dropped: rape of an intoxicated person and rape of an unconscious person. It was decided that he would stand trial for the three other felony counts. Turner was found guilty of raping the woman. His sentencing was scheduled for June 2, and he faced a maximum of 10 years behind bars. (Prosecutors were arguing for six years.) According to the Associated Press Opens a New Window. , Turner is appealing his decision.On June 2, Judge Persky sentenced Turner to just six months of jail and three years of probation for his actions. Turner must also register as a sex offender. Persky noted that he came to the decision because of Turner's clean criminal record and that a harsher punishment would have left a 'severe impact' on him. 'I think he will not be a danger to others,'' Judge Persky said, via CNN. One day earlier, Stanford University released a statement defending the way it handled the situation. 'Once Stanford learned the identity of the young woman involved, the university reached out confidentially to offer her support and to tell her the steps we were taking. In less than two weeks after the incident, Stanford had conducted an investigation and banned Turner from setting foot on campus — as a student or otherwise. This is the harshest sanction that a university can impose on a student,'' the statement said. 'This was a horrible incident, and we understand the anger and deep emotion it has generated. There is still much work to be done, not just here, but everywhere, to create a culture that does not tolerate sexual violence in any form and a judicial system that deals appropriately with sexual assault cases.' \n\n Story from US News",

"Bill Cosby: Bill Cosby suffered a defeat in court Wednesday evening. Actually, he suffered two defeats. In addition to rejecting a bid to dismiss the three counts of sexual assault against him, a Pennsylvania judge also turned down a request by Cosby's lawyers to remove newly elected Montgomery County Dist. Atty. Kevin Steele from the case. Steele had campaigned on a prosecute-Cosby platform, and the defense said he couldn't argue it fairly. The judge, Steven O'Neill, disagreed. Wednesday's developments mean the road to a trial is now a lot clearer. Instead of going away, the charges will now yield a preliminary hearing on March 8 to determine whether the prosecution has enough evidence to win in front of a jury. If the judge — a new one, Elizabeth McHugh — determines it does, the case moves to a full-blown trial. Experts think this is likely to happen. A trial would be a weighty affair. The incident in early 2004, in which Cosby provided unidentified pills at his Pennsylvania home to former Temple University basketball employee Andrea Constand and then penetrated her with his fingers, is charged in its own right. Was the act consensual, as Cosby has argued? Or was it an unwanted and illegal violation, as the prosecution has said? Victims of sexual assault and women's groups, however, see a larger issue. A trial, they say, would offer a chance to level the scales with Cosby, against whom more than 50 other women have made similar accusations, and even settle the score in what they argue is a larger culture of privileged men who routinely get away with sex crimes. Just a few days ago, the defense looked like it had a chance to make the charges disappear. So how did we get to this place? Here's how Cosby's case stalled in a Pennsylvania courtroom. The defense's star witness was Bruce Castor. Castor was district attorney when the incident happened, and the person who the defense said made an ironclad oral agreement not to prosecute Cosby in perpetuity. Castor said he had told his intentions to Walter Phillips, Cosby's longtime criminal attorney, and no one else. The problem is Phillips died last year, leaving only one side of the party to testify to it. What's more, Castor shied away from actually calling it an agreement — he demurred when pressed by attorneys. O'Neill sought to clarify: 'So it was an agreement with yourself?' Why would Castor make such an agreement? He has some unconventional reasoning. More on that in a bit. The news release. To provide evidence for this promise, Castor and the defense pointed to a 2005 news release announcing Castor's intention not to prosecute Cosby. Castor took the unusual step of writing and signing it himself, which the defense argued gave it legal force. But Judge O'Neill queried him on why, if he was making a binding commitment, he didn't tender something more official, pointing out the ways he could have filed it with the court. Equally problematic for the defense was the phrasing in the news release. Castor wrote in it that he would 'reconsider this decision should the need arise' — fairly open language that leaves room for it to be recanted. Castor said he personally believed Cosby was probably guilty. But he didn't think the case was winnable, and opted against prosecuting to help the victim — by doing so, he said, he would remove Cosby's privilege to plead the 5th Amendment in a civil suit. The argument was undercut, however, when lawyers for the victim, Dolores Troiani and Bebe Kivitz, testified that Castor had never informed them of this rationale, a notable omission if he was in fact trying to help their case. And the idea of a prosecutor acting on this motivation is odd, experts say. 'When you cut a deal to give someone immunity you want to get something in return,' said Dennis C. McAndrews, a former Philadelphia-area prosecutor, noting such benefits as witness testimony. 'It's not a prosecutor's job to enhance a civil case for a victim.' Part of why the defense argued the case shouldn't move forward is because Steele reopened the investigation in the wake of the unsealing last summer of a deposition from the 2005 civil suit. In it, Cosby admitted he had previously bought Quaaludes to facilitate sex with women. And that testimony, the defense argued, was given when Cosby believed he had criminal immunity. The judge, however, noted that details from the deposition were only a part of Steele's case — and, in any event, the specific matter of whether the deposition material was admissible could be argued in a separate hearing without derailing the whole case. That hearing is, in fact, one of several legal matters that could be decided in advance of a trial. Another could involve Cosby's competency to stand trial in the first place. He's 78, appears frail, and his vision problems have been on display this week, with aides guiding him and out of the courthouse. Also coming under scrutiny in a likely pretrial hearing is the hot-button question of whether testimony from other women Cosby allegedly assaulted will be allowed. Pennsylvania does allow such testimony if it's pertinent in establishing a pattern of conduct or signature crime. The matter will be decided in what's known as a motion in limine, in which prosecutors will probably argue that the testimony is necessary for exactly these reasons and a defense will contend that it's irrelevant to this case. One alleged victim who will certainly be testifying is Constand. She is likely to take the stand on March 8, as prosecutors seek try to convince a judge that there is sufficient evidence to win a case. She'll offer her version of what happened that night in Cosby's home. The trial will have not yet begun, but the media storm certainly will. Story from the Los Angeles Times",

"Harvey Weinstein: An unidentified woman, who has accused Harvey Weinstein of raping her in a Gramercy Park apartment more than a quarter of a century ago, will be a prosecution witness in his upcoming trial, newly unsealed court documents show. The filings were made public on Friday by both sides in the case. The Hollywood film producer is slated to stand trial in September. Weinstein faces a minimum of 10 years behind bars on the top count of predatory sexual assault, which requires pattern conduct of charged or uncharged crimes. From context in the court documents, it appears the accuser’s testimony will be used to support the Manhattan District Attorney’s case against Weinstein for repeated conduct. The filings contained few details about the alleged incident, and prosecutors argued that Weinstein’s side was not entitled to know much more about it. According to an April 25 filing by Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi, the incident occurred “in the early part of 1993, at a residence located on Gramercy Park North (East 21st Street) in the evening.” Prosecutors said in the documents that the woman’s name had been given to Weinstein’s side and that she had accused Weinstein of forcing her to have sex with him. Last October, the District Attorney’s Office dismissed a count relating to an accusation by Lucia Evans, who had said Weinstein of sexually assaulted her in his Manhattan office in 2004. Weinstein is accused of sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haley in 2006 and an unidentified person at a Double Tree Hotel on Lexington Ave. in 2013. He has been charged with rape, criminal sex act and predatory sexual assault. Dozens of women have accused him of sexual misconduct. Weinstein has denied the accusations and said he did not have non-consensual sex with any of his accusers. “Mr. Weinstein’s legal team is prepared to address and defeat the challenges faced and accusations made,” Juda Engelmayer, a representative for Weinstein’s legal team, said on Friday.

"Larry Nassar: Once a world-renowned sports physician treating America's foremost Olympic women gymnasts, Larry Nassar now will spend the rest of his life behind bars. The disgraced former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University doctor was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison, a judge announced Wednesday, after more than 150 women and girls said in court that he sexually abused them over the past two decades. 'I've just signed your death warrant,' Judge Rosemarie Aquilina said in a Lansing, Michigan, courtroom. 'I find that you don't get it, that you're a danger. That you remain a danger.' Nassar had pleaded guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct in Ingham County in Michigan and admitted to using his trusted medical position to assault and molest girls under the guise of medical treatment. He offered a short statement in court, apologizing and saying that hearing seven days of victim impact statements had shaken him to his core. 'There are no words that can describe the depth and breadth of how sorry I am for what has occurred,' Nassar said. 'An acceptable apology to all of you is impossible to write and convey. I will carry your words with me for the rest of my days.' But before delivering her sentence, Aquilina read aloud a letter Nassar wrote to the court recently in which he defended his medical care, said he was 'manipulate' into pleading guilty, and accused the women of lying. 'I was a good doctor because my treatments worked, and those patients that are now speaking out are the same ones that praised and came back over and over,' Nassar wrote. 'The media convinced them that everything I did was wrong and bad. They feel I broke their trust. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.' The letter 'tells me you still don't get it,' Aquilina said, tossing the letter dismissively. 'I wouldn't send my dogs to you, sir,' she added. The sentence brings to an end a wrenching seven days of victim impact statements as part of Nassar's plea deal. A total of 156 victims spoke, recounting similar stories of how they went to Nassar to receive treatment for sports injuries only to be sexually assaulted and told it was a form of treatment. 'The breadth and ripple of this defendant's abuse and destruction is nearly infinite,' Assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis said in her remarks before the sentencing. Many of the women said that when they spoke up about the treatment, they were ignored or their concerns brushed aside by organizations in power, primarily USA Gymnastics, Michigan State University and the US Olympic Committee. The final speaker was Rachael Denhollander, the former gymnast who first made Nassar's abuse public in a September 2016 story in the Indy Star. She meticulously laid out the ways that the systems failed her and other women and allowed this abuse to continue for so long. 'Women and girls banded together to fight for themselves because no one else would do it,' she said. Nassar sat and listened on the witness stand, sometimes hiding his head in his hands or wiping away tears with a tissue. Separately, he has already been sentenced to 60 years in prison for federal child pornography charges. He also has pleaded guilty to three charges of criminal sexual conduct in Eaton County in Michigan and is due to be sentenced on those charges on January 31. Between the three sentences, Nassar, 54, will never get out of prison, Aquilina said. But the judge reminded everyone in the courtroom that the focus of the week-long sentencing hearing was the victims -- or survivors, as many have called themselves. One by one, women and their families came forward to confront Nassar and explain how he used his respected position to molest young, injured girls. 'I think what we've seen over the past week may have been a watershed moment in our country,' said attorney John Manly, who represents more than 100 women in civil lawsuits. '(This happened) because these women had the courage to get up and speak.' The women -- almost all of whom initially met Nassar for a sports-related injury -- said that, because of the abuse, they struggled with anxiety, depression and instances of self-harm. Others said they no longer trust doctors or that they shrink from any physical touch. 'Sexual abuse is so much more than a disturbing physical act,' Kyle Stephens, the first victim to speak, said last week. 'It changes the trajectory of a victim's life, and that is something that nobody has the right to do.' But the women also showed remarkable resolve and bravery, staring down Nassar in court and calling out the systems of power that protected him for more than two decades. The victims include some of the most famous Olympic gymnasts in American history, including gold medalist Aly Raisman, as well as athletes at Michigan State University and at USA Gymnastics. 'We, this group of women you so heartlessly abused over such a long period of time, are now a force, and you are nothing,' Raisman said. 'The tables have turned, Larry. We are here. We have our voices, and we are not going anywhere.' Court officials initially expected 88 victims to speak in court. But that number nearly doubled over the course of the sentencing hearing as more and more women came forward, inspired to speak out by what many called an 'army of survivors.' 'We were ultimately strong enough to take you down,' Kaylee Lorincz said on Wednesday. 'Not one by one, but by an army of survivors. We are Jane Does no more.' Judge Aquilina allowed everyone who wished to speak a chance to be heard, and she offered personal responses to each woman in court. Legal experts said her intimate comments were unusual, but Nassar's victims praised Aquilina for doing what so many others had failed to do: listen. Though the sentencing marks the end of Nassar's time in the public eye, it has focused critical attention on USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic Committee and Michigan State University, the institutions that employed Nassar for about two decades. A number of women have accused the organizations of turning a blind eye to Nassar's abuse and even pressuring outspoken victims into silence. 'Michigan State University, the school I loved and trusted, had the audacity to tell me that I did not understand the difference between sexual assault and a medical procedure,' Amanda Thomashow said in court. 'That master manipulator took advantage of his title, he abused me, and when I found the strength to talk about what had happened I was ignored and my voice was silenced.' All three organizations have denied wrongdoing and said they reported the sexual abuse allegations to authorities once they learned about them. Still, the fallout at those organizations has moved slowly and then all at once. Michigan State University asked the state attorney general to investigate its response to the abuse, and President Lou Anna Simon has faced calls for her resignation. In the past week, USA Gymnastics cut ties with the Karolyi Ranch, the training facility where the abuse happened, and three leaders of its board stepped down under pressure. The US Olympic Committee called on the rest of the USA Gymnastics board to step down and said it was considering decertifying USA Gymnastics as a national governing body, according to a statement from USOC CEO Scott Blackmun on Wednesday. The USOC statement also apologized for failing to stop Nassar's abuse and for its inadequate response at his trial. 'The purpose of this message is to tell all of Nassar's victims and survivors, directly, how incredibly sorry we are,' Blackmun wrote. 'We have said it in other contexts, but we have not been direct enough with you. We are sorry for the pain caused by this terrible man, and sorry that you weren't afforded a safe opportunity to pursue your sports dreams. 'The Olympic family is among those that have failed you.'",

 "Steubenville HS: STEUBENVILLE, Ohio — Two high school football stars were found guilty on Sunday of raping a 16-year-old girl last summer in a case that drew national attention for the way social media spurred the initial prosecution and later helped galvanize national outrage. Because the victim did not remember what had happened, scores of text messages and cellphone pictures provided much of the evidence. They were proof as well, some said, that Steubenville High School’s powerhouse football team held too much sway over other teenagers, who documented and traded pictures of the assault while doing little or nothing to protect the girl. One of the football players, Trent Mays, 17, who had been a quarterback, was sentenced to serve at least two years in the state juvenile system. The other, Ma’lik Richmond, 16, who had played wide receiver, was sentenced to serve at least one year. Both could end up in juvenile jail until they are 21, at the discretion of the State Department of Youth Services. Mr. Mays’s minimum sentence is twice as long as Mr. Richmond’s because he was found to be delinquent beyond a reasonable doubt — the juvenile equivalent of guilty — not just of rape but also of distributing a nude image of a minor. After Judge Thomas Lipps read his decision in Juvenile Court, both boys sobbed. Mr. Richmond told his lawyer, Walter Madison, 'My life is over.' Mr. Mays apologized to the victim by name, as well as to her family and the community. 'No pictures should have been sent around, let alone ever taken,' he said. Mr. Richmond then walked toward the family and said: 'I had not intended to do anything like this. I’m sorry to put you through this.' After that he broke down, unable to speak, and embraced a court officer. The judge found that both boys used their fingers to penetrate the girl in the early hours of Aug. 12 while she was so drunk that she lacked the cognitive ability to give her consent for sex. A picture that was circulated among classmates later that day showed the victim naked and passed out. Ohio’s legal definition of rape includes digital penetration. Judge Lipps described much of the evidence as “profane and ugly.' In sentencing the boys, he said rape was among the gravest of crimes and noted that they could have been tried as adults with far harsher punishments. He also said the case was a cautionary lesson in how teenagers conduct themselves when alcohol is present and in 'how you record things on social media that are so prevalent today.' The trial also exposed the behavior of other teenagers, who wasted no time spreading photos and text messages with what many in the community felt was callousness or cruelty. And that aspect of the case may not be complete. The Ohio attorney general, Mike DeWine, said after the verdict that he would convene a grand jury next month to finish the investigation. In an interview, Mr. DeWine said that while it was not clear that more people would face charges, prosecutors might consider offenses that include obstruction of justice, failure to report a felony and failure to report child abuse. State officials have interviewed almost 60 people — students, coaches, school officials and parents — but 16, most of them juveniles, have refused to speak to investigators. The verdict came after four days of testimony that was notable for how Ohio investigators analyzed hundreds of text messages from more than a dozen cellphones and created something like a real-time accounting of the assault. As these messages were read aloud, Judge Lipps heard Mr. Mays state that he had used his fingers to penetrate the girl, whom he referred to in a separate message as 'like a dead body.' In another message, Mr. Mays admitted to the girl that he had taken the picture, already circulated among other students, of her lying naked in a basement with what he told her was his semen on her body, from what he stated was a consensual sex act. Other text messages suggested that Mr. Mays had grown increasingly worried within a day or two, urging a friend to curb the distribution of a video related to the assault. He also seemed to try to orchestrate a cover-up, telling a friend, 'Just say she came to your house and passed out.' Finally, the messages showed Mr. Mays pleading with the girl not to press charges because doing so would damage his football career — even as the girl grew angry that he seemed to care more about football than her welfare. On Saturday, the girl testified that for the roughly six-hour period during which the rapes occurred, she had no memory of anything aside from a brief vomiting episode. She said she had woken up the next morning naked in the basement living room surrounded by Mr. Mays, Mr. Richmond and another boy, with no idea where she was or how she had gotten there and unable to find her underwear, shoes, earrings or phone.One classmate testified that he had seen Mr. Mays also penetrate the girl while they rode in the back seat of a car. Far more evidence and testimony were about Mr. Mays. Mr. Richmond mainly faced the testimony of Evan Westlake, another student, who said Mr. Richmond had used his fingers to penetrate the girl while she lay in the basement. Testimony also touched the high school’s football coach, Reno Saccoccia, who had been criticized by some in the community for not doing more to discipline other players present. In one text message, Mr. Mays stated that he felt he had gotten the coach to 'take care of it' and that Mr. Saccoccia 'was joking about it so I’m not that worried.' In the end, the most powerful evidence may have been the two hours of testimony from the 16-year-old girl herself. Under questioning from the prosecution, she told the story of waking up confused, naked, ashamed and worried, and then finding out that day that many of her friends had an idea what had happened to her or had even seen a picture of her naked. The girl also testified that she had come to realize that Mr. Mays — who maintained that he had taken care of her while she was drunk and that their encounter had been consensual and did not involve penetration — had done far more. 'This is the most pointless thing,” Mr. Mays said in one text message to the girl. “I’m going to get in trouble for something I should be getting thanked for taking care of you.' But the girl made clear that she was not having any more of it, telling Mr. Mays in another exchange: 'It’s on YouTube. I’m not stupid. Stop texting me.' Story from the New York Times. "];
